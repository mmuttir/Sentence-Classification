# BERT Fine-Tuning for Sentence Classification

In this project, we will fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model for sentence classification using the CoLA dataset. The sections covered in this markdown include:

- Introduction
- Methodology
- Results

## Introduction

The BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, developed by researchers at Google AI, has shown significant improvements in various natural language processing tasks. In this project, we will use the BERT model to perform sentence classification on the Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA) dataset. The dataset consists of sentences labeled as grammatically correct or incorrect.

## Methodology

We will follow these steps to fine-tune the BERT model for sentence classification:

1. Install and import required libraries.
2. Load and preprocess the CoLA dataset.
3. Tokenize and pad the input sentences.
4. Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
5. Fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model.
6. Evaluate the model on the test dataset.

## Results

After fine-tuning, the BERT model achieved a high validation accuracy and a significant Matthew's correlation coefficient on the test dataset, indicating its effectiveness in the sentence classification task.
